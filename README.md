# Snake_Game

A classic Snake Game built using Java and essential Java libraries like JFrame, JPanel, and ActionListener. This project showcases basic game development concepts, including event handling, GUI components, and animation in Java.

# Features of the Snake Game
<ul>
  <li>The game provides a classic Snake experience with smooth and responsive controls. Players can easily navigate the snake using arrow keys, making the game enjoyable and intuitive.
Difficulty Levels</li>
  <li>Choose from Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty levels. Each difficulty affects the snake’s speed, giving players the option to challenge themselves as they progress.
Apple Counter and Scoring System</li>
  <li>Tracks the number of apples eaten during the game. The score is displayed on the game-over screen, allowing players to keep track of their achievements and strive for higher scores.
Game-Over Message</li>
  <li>A custom game-over screen with a "Game Over!" message and the final score. This adds a polished touch and provides feedback on performance after each round.
Collision Detection</li>
  <li>The game detects collisions with the wall and the snake’s own body, ending the game when either occurs. This feature adds a realistic challenge to the gameplay.
Responsive and Fixed Game Window</li>
  <li>The game window is fixed at 300x300 pixels with a sleek black background, ensuring a consistent look and feel across devices.
Graphics and Icon Integration</li>
  <li>Engaging graphics for the snake’s head, body, and apple. This visual enhancement makes the game more appealing and enjoyable to play.
Modular Code Structure</li>
  <li>The game is organized into separate classes (e.g., SnakeGame and Board), making the code more maintainable and easy to understand.
Keyboard Control with Arrow Keys</li>
  <li>Players control the snake using the Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow keys, with smooth directional changes even during gameplay.
Random Apple Placement</li>
  <li>Apples appear randomly on the board, but not on the snake's body. This feature adds randomness and keeps each game unique.</li>
</ul>

# Technologies Used
